## Overview
Emu is 2D game engine which has a backend written entirely in C++. The main use case of this engine 
is to build simple 2D tile based simulations. Clients can primarily interact with the engine via
a text file based tile map and a "rules" json file. The map and rules file format is detailed below. 
The engine api is not strict and can be extended as necessary. Clients should have an understanding of
C++ and JSON to effectively use the engine.

## Support
Currently, EMU is only supported on Windows.
